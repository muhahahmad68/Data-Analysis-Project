# Project Title Here

Analysis of Supermarket Data across 3 different locations in the country.

# Project Steps

1. Importing of necessary libraries
2. Reading our data to csv 
3. Checking the shape and columns in the data
4. Checking for null in the dataset
5. Checking for appropriate datatypes in each columns
6. Checking for categorical columns and getting some insight from there.
7. Generating different charts to answer some important question.

# Insights
From the analysis made, it is seen that port-harcourt has highest gross income, 'Food and beverages' and fashion accessories are the most sold product line in PH, since food is an impoertant aspect of living it is safe to see the reason why they generate the highest gross income. Also majority of the cutomers that paid in cash are from PH and it has the highest rating as well, looks like port-harcout is a safe and suitable place for customers.

Lagos on the other hand has many people who purhase 'home and lifestyle' then 'electronic'. Looks like people in Lagos are more concerned about their lifestyle. Many people in Lagos also paid using Epay.seems Lagos is not very safe, even most of the customers would have come before 19:00. 

Customers in Abuja arrive as late as 19:00, Abuja looks safe compared to lagos, considering closing later might be a good option. 
 
# Future Work

I would try checking the correlation between mode of payment and unit price/total.

# Standout Section

I found out the time majority of customers buy their goods in respective location.
Majority of good sold per branch 
Use of violin plot.

# Executive Summary.
